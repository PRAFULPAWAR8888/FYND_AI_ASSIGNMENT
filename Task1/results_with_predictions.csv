"This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.

"Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!  The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.  They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.  I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!  Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.    It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's 'chill' attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.  It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!  Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!",5,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:47:14.5482613Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=54310825600 load_duration=174653500 prompt_eval_count=689 prompt_eval_duration=50443696500 eval_count=30 eval_duration=3565693800 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{""predicted_stars"":4,""explanation"":""Excellent food, service, and atmosphere, with only minor issues with refilling water glasses.""}', thinking=None, images=None, tool_name=None, tool_calls=None) logprobs=None","{'predicted_stars': 4, 'explanation': 'Excellent food, service, and atmosphere, with only minor issues with refilling water glasses.'}",4,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:48:14.2190778Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=59667051100 load_duration=242442300 prompt_eval_count=742 prompt_eval_duration=57179470400 eval_count=17 eval_duration=2196521300 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{""predicted_stars"": 5, ""explanation"": ""very positive""}', thinking=None, images=None, tool_name=None, tool_calls=None) logprobs=None","{'predicted_stars': 5, 'explanation': 'very positive'}",5,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:49:24.4403818Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=70216705600 load_duration=263013500 prompt_eval_count=682 prompt_eval_duration=57283664100 eval_count=89 eval_duration=12491077100 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{\n    ""predicted_stars"": 5,\n    ""explanation"": ""The reviewer had an exceptional dining experience, praising the cozy atmosphere, attentive but laid-back service, and delicious food.

"Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right?  I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either.  The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb.  What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isn't their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I don't take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop). For this I am grateful for the light rail for late night Phoenix excursions.   Metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past 3 years, it seems to be going on the right route.",3,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:51:10.0712812Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=42695926100 load_duration=266375500 prompt_eval_count=499 prompt_eval_duration=37626474300 eval_count=32 eval_duration=4602380300 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{""predicted_stars"":4,""explanation"":""Generally positive review of the bus station, but criticizes safety concerns and poor maintenance at other stations.""}', thinking=None, images=None, tool_name=None, tool_calls=None) logprobs=None","{'predicted_stars': 4, 'explanation': 'Generally positive review of the bus station, but criticizes safety concerns and poor maintenance at other stations.'}",4,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:51:54.6285747Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=44545552600 load_duration=331251300 prompt_eval_count=552 prompt_eval_duration=41401079400 eval_count=17 eval_duration=2747928800 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{""predicted_stars"": 4, ""explanation"": ""mostly positive""}', thinking=None, images=None, tool_name=None, tool_calls=None) logprobs=None","{'predicted_stars': 4, 'explanation': 'mostly positive'}",4,"model='llama3.2:latest' created_at='2025-12-07T07:52:54.3015569Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=59615144300 load_duration=529684500 prompt_eval_count=492 prompt_eval_duration=43660699200 eval_count=96 eval_duration=15138864900 message=Message(role='assistant', content='{\n  ""predicted_stars"": 4,\n  ""explanation"": ""The reviewer generally enjoys their experience with public transportation in Tempe, praising the clustering of the bus depot and feeling safe at night.

"At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.  Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.  In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it.
